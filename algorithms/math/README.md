## Arithmetic algorithms üßÆ

<font size="+1">
Arithmetic algorithms module provides essential tools for numerical computations.
It includes functions for binary search, Babylonian sqare root calculation,
binary exponentiation, and both iterative and recursive factorial calculations.
<br>

```
from algorithms.math.arithmetic_algorithms import (
    binary_search,
    babylonian_sqrt
    binary_exponentiation,
    iterative_factorial,
    recursive_factorial,
)
```

#### Binary search

```
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
looked_number = 30
result = binary_search(numbers, looked_number) 

print(f'Index of number {looked_number} in numbers: {result}')   # 2 
```

#### Babylonian square root finder

```
number = 225
square_root = babylonian_sqrt(number)

print(f'Square root of number {number} in equal to: {square_root}')   # 15
```

#### Binary exponentiation

```
number = 4
power = 5
num_raised_to_pow = binary_exponentiation(number, power)

print(f'Number {number} raised to power {power} equals: {num_raised_to_pow}')   # 1025
```  

#### Iterative factorial

```
number = 8
factorial = iterative_factorial(number)

print(f'Factorial of number {number} is equal: {factorial}')                    # 40320
```  

#### Recursive factorial

```
number = 5
factorial = recursive_factorial(number)

print(f'Factorial of number {number} is equal: {factorial}')                    # 120
```

## Geometric algorithms üìê

<font size="+1">
This module provides essential tools for geometrical computations. It includes functions
to calculate distances between points in a 2-dimensional plane, check if three points
are collinear, verify if given side length can form a valid triangle, and determine if
a triangle with given side lengths is a rectangular triangle.
<br>

```
from algorithms.math.geometric_algorithms import (
    Point,
    distance_between_points,
    are_points_collinear,
    is_triangle_valid,
    is_triangle_rectangular,
)

```

#### Distance between points

```
# Creating two instances of Point class

point_1 = Point(-2, -3)
point_2 = Point(1, 1)
distance = distance_between_points(point_1, point_2)

print(f'Distance between point_1 {point_1} and point_2 {point_2} is equal {distance}')   # 5.0 
```

#### Checking collinearity of 3 points

```
# Creating three instances of Point class

point_1 = Point(-12, -14)
point_2 = Point(10, 30)
point_3 = Point(300, 610)
collinearity_result = are_points_collinear(point_1, point_2, points_3)

print(f'Point_1, point_2 and point_3 are collinear: {collinearity_result}')   # True
```

#### Checking triangle validity

```
a_side = 5
b_side = 10
c_side = 8
# Invalid triangle with c_side_2 
c_side_2 = 3

validity_result = is_triangle_valid(a_side, b_side, c_side)
validity_result_2  = is_triangle_valid(a_side, b_side, c_side_2)

print(f'Triangle with sides {a_side}, {b_side} and {c_side} is a valid triangle: {validity_result}')       # True 
print(f'Triangle with sides {a_side}, {b_side} and {c_side_2} is a valid triangle: {validity_result_2}')   # False 
```

#### Checking if triangle is rectangular

```
a_side = 3
b_side = 4
c_side = 5

d_side = 1
e_side = 1
f_side = 1

result = is_triangle_rectangular(a_side, b_side, c_side)
result_2 = is_triangle_rectangular(d_side, e_side, f_side)

print(f'Triangle with sides {a_side}, {b_side} and {c_side} is rectangular: {result}')      # True
print(f'Triangle with sides {d_side}, {e_side} and {f_side} is rectangular: {result_2}')    # False
