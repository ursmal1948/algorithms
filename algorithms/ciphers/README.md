# üîê CIPHERS PACKAGE üîê
## Overview
<font size="+1">
Welcome to the "ciphers" package of the "algorithms" library. This package
provides implementations of various classical ciphers, including 
Vigen√®re cipher, Caesar cipher, and Morse code.
</font>

## Installation
<font size="+1">
To install the "algorithms" library and access this package, you can use pip:<br>
<br>
  
```
pip install algorithms
```

</font>

## Usage
<font size="+1">
Once installed, you can import the ciphers package and utilize its functionalities in Python projects 
</font>

## Vigen√®re Cipher
<font size="+1">
The Vigen√®re cipher uses a 26√ó26 table with A to Z as the row heading and column heading. This table
is usually referred to as the Vigen√®re Square.The first row of this table has the 26
English letters. Starting with the second row, each row has the letters 
shifted to the left one position in a cyclic way. For example, when B is shifted to 
the first position on the second row, the letter A moves to the end.<br>
Here's how you can use it:
<br>
  
```
from algorithms.ciphers import vigenere
```

```
# Creating an instance of Vigen√®re square
key = "CAT" <br>
vigenere_square = VigenereCipher("CAT")
```

```
# Encrypting a message
plaintext = "HOME"
encrypted_text = vigenere_square.encrypt(plaintext)<br>
print(f'Encrypted: {encrypted_text}')
```
```
# Decrypting a message
decrypted_text = vigenere_square.decrypt(encrypted_text)
print(f'Decrypted: {decrypted_text}')
```  
</font>

## Caesar Cipher 
<font size="+1">
The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely 
known encryption techniques. It shifts the letters of the alphabet by a certain 
number of places.<br>
Here's how you can use it:

```
from algorithms.ciphers import caesar
```

```
# Creating an instance of Caesar cipher
shift = 2
caesar_cipher = CaesarCipher(shift)
```
```
# Encrypting a message
plaintext = 'ABCD'
encrypted_text = caesar_cipher.encrypt(plaintext)
print(f'Encrypted: {encrypted_text}')
```
```
# Decrypting a message
decrypted_text = caesar_cipher.decrypt(encrypted_text)
print(f'Decrypted: {decrypted_text}')
```
</font>
